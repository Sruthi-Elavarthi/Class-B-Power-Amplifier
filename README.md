# Class-B-Power-Amplifier
A power amplifier must produce a considerable amount of power amplification so as to drive a load. One way to greatly boost the current gain ( Ai ) of a Class B push-pull amplifier is to use Darlington transistors pairs instead of single transistors in its output circuitry.
